Do PM's get all the insights and requirements to build a successful product from the research team? No, no they don't. We get insights and requirements from pretty much everyone. 

**Key**: Somehow, figure out how to prioritize all the incoming requests and needs.

Once a requirement gets identified, I start a PRD - or "Product Requirement Document;. 

## Identifying Requirements

* Research
* User Interviews
* Stakeholder interviews
* Prototyping
* PRD - KEEP UP TO DATE! 

You can never really be sure that you have identified all the requirements. It's important to minimize changes to the requirements after the PRD has been finalized, but occasionally I will identify important additional requirements when I get new information.

Users cannot tell me exactly what the product should do. To take a quote from the amazing Henry Ford - "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses". Users might be able to tell me what they think the product should do, but often its worth pushing to understand their need deeper. 

## Where we are vs where we want to be - The Product Roadmap.

* Tells a cohesive story - why the product is important
* Get buy in - facilitate conversations about building the right thing, at the right time.
* Say NO! - Deciding what NOT to build. "Innovations is not about saying yes to everything. Its all about saying NO to all but the most crucial features" - Steve Jobs
* Attach goals - better understand impact.

Not every feature request should go in a roadmap. It's important to keep the team focused on creating the most value and saying no to distractions. Roadmaps can be used to spark conversations around what is being built. PRDs don't detail HOW the product works, they focus on WHAT the product should do.

##### WHAT the team is building and WHY

*Background* - frame the problem - provide any relevant background information about the industry or problem

*Problem* - Frame the problem - describe the opportunity. What are the benefits to the user? What are key insights? What's the competition do? Why does this matter?

*Goals* : Frame the problem - What does success look like? both user goals, business goals, and success metrics. This section also helps to explain WHY the problem should be solved

*Success Metrics* - Frame the problem - How do you measure success?

*Key Features & Scope* - Handoff : What are you building? What are you explicitly not building? 

*Core UX Flow* - Handoff : Links to Mocks

*Assumptions* : 

*Other Options Considered* : 

*Out of Scope* : 

*Risks & Mitigations* : (How things can go wrong)

*Support Plan* : Foresee needing customer support 

As a PM, I spend tons of time answering 'WHAT' should our product do and aligning internal teams to execute (sometimes) against their vision. I use roadmaps and PRDs to communicate what the product SHOULD do...

Both Roadmaps and PRDs should evolve over time as the team is iterating through problems and gets new information.
