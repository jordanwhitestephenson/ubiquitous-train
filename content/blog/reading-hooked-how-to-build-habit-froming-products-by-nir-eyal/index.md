Somedays, I could care less about reading a book at night. Reading 'Hooked' however, is addicting. I foresee this book becoming a 'bible' in my career. The theories and real-life examples Nir Eyal includes in this book is beyond thought provoking. I am currently on the chapter about the 'Investment' stage of consumer behavior. 

> 'The more users invest time and effort into a product or service, the more they value it. In fact, there is ample evidence to suggest that our labor leads to love" - Excerpt from Hooked

The Investment stage explains our human tendency to value our hard work. During this critically timed step, users are asked to do a bit of WORK! Our rationalization is that anything we spend time on, we start to believe, 'This must be worthwile. Why? Because I've spent a lot of time on it!'.  In the Investment step, users are prompted to put something of value into the system, which increases the likelihood of their using the product and of successive passes through the cycle. 

For example, Twitter has captures the Investment step in the form of following another user. There is no immediate reward for following someone, no stars or badges to affirm the action. Following is an investment in the service, which increases the likelihood of the user checking Twitter in the future. 

In the investment phase, however, asking users to do a bit of work comes AFTER users have received variable rewards, NOT before. By asking for the investment after the reward, the company has an opportunity to leverage a central trait of human behavior. 

> "Conceivably, we humans evolved the tendency to reciprocate kindness because it improved our species ability to survive"

The big idea behind the investment phase is to leverage the user's understanding that the service will get better with use (and personal investment). Like a good friendship, the more effort put in, the both parties benefit.

The stored value users put into the product increases the likelihood they will try to use it again in the future and comes in a variety of forms.
