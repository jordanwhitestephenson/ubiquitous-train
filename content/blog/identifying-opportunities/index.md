Why is it so important to identify the right problems to solve? Well, there is only so much time in a day, and each problem has a different level of impact. 

What can I control while building a product? I can control the problem I am solving, the product I am building and the people on my team. What can I not control? The market!

Understanding the market is critical to building successful products. This is what we call 'Product/market fit".

## What makes a good market? 

1. Size
2. Growth (is the market growing? Aka smart phones)
3. Acquisition - how easy is it to get new customers?
4. Users get value from product

6. Press is reaching out to talk to you about your product
7. Fast growth
