As I learn to understand what exactly this 'product management' role would mean, I learned today about **BRD**(Business Requirement Document) or a**PRD**(Product Requirement Document). So wait, what will I be writing? Tackling the first word, BRD. As a developer, I've always scoffed at other developers needlessly using overcomplicated terminology. I hope this subject isn't related. Anyways, lets tackel BRD. 

* `A Good Business Requirement Document are as follows`

  * `It includes the whole customer experience (user goals, user interaction and visual design`
  * `Is includes different phases of the product`
  * `Able to be understood by all teams (which I figured would be a given?)`
  * `Accompanied by a high-fidelity prototype`

`As I continue reading about high-fidelity prototypes, I start getting excited. Although my previous career was a software developer, I played around with creating mockups as a guilty pleasure. As I designed, I imagined how this mockup could bring about increased revenue. `

* `How To Create a highfidelity prototype:`

  1) Create a detailed high fidelity prototype with your product   designer
  2 ) Set up a meeting with your team to slice up the features

Also, the job sounds sweet on paper:
Youâ€™re the Mini-CEO
You lead others
You are the industry expert
You decide how the product looks and feels today and in the future
You get paid well
You da boss
