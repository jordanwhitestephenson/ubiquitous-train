I like to break up my design sprint into 6 phases. 

## 1. Understand

Create a shared understanding of the problem space, the user, the competition, and why it all matters. Align as a team on a focus moving forward for the rest of the sprint

## 2. Define

Start by focusing on where you want to end. By setting goals you can work backwards to understand what needs to happen in order to get there.

## 3. Sketch

Ideate. Start diverging and exploring lots of different solutions.

## 4. Decide

Bring it all back together and decide on one idea to take through prototyping and validation

## 5. Prototype

Map out and build a prototype of your idea

## 6. Validate

Check to make sure that your idea is solving a real user need… and that it can be built!

Each phase has a set of tools that can be used to facilitate reaching the goal of each phase. Remember, it’s not necessary to use every tool for a given phase. Instead you should focus on picking the best tool for the problem you are trying to tackle and the composition of your sprint team. We’ll learn more about the tools you can use in the lessons for each phase.



# Who should we involve?

* Members should bring different perspectives, backgrounds, and areas of expertise
* Team typically includes someone from Product, Design, and Engineering - but there’s no hard and fast rule
* Need to find the right people to bring perspective and focus to the current challenge .
